-- Guard collapse_accumulating_book against a stale read (TOCTOU money loss).
--
-- The route reads the book's tranches (T1), values each tranche's interest, then
-- calls this RPC with those (tranche_id → interest) arrays (T2). If a NEW top-up
-- commits between T1 and T2, the RPC's loop sees it (it matches the WHERE), but it
-- is absent from p_tranche_ids — so it would be snapshotted with NULL interest and
-- deleted, while its principal was never in the user's lump amount. The money in
-- that fresh tranche would silently vanish.
--
-- It's a narrow window (same user, two near-simultaneous actions), but the failure
-- mode is lost money, so close it hard: if the loop meets a live tranche that the
-- caller didn't account for (array_position returns NULL), the book changed under
-- us — raise and let the whole collapse roll back. The client reloads and retries
-- against the current book. (A tranche that was concurrently DELETED is the
-- opposite case and harmless: it simply never appears in the loop.)
--
-- Body is otherwise identical to 20260618000002 — see it and 20260618000001 for the
-- full rationale on the coupled, atomic writes.
